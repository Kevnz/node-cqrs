/*
 * Aggregate is the cluster of system entities and value objects used to 
 * maintain transactional consistency. It's recommended to keep reasonably small
 * and keep business driven set of invariants. 
 *
 * RECOMMENDED ARCHITECTURE
 *
 * COMMANDS
 * Command executes the behavior of the aggregate. It takes arguments, which
 * are necessary to let the command be executed, interact with current aggregate
 * state and at the end should result in either throwing an exception if something
 * goes wrong or with emit() call, in order to store information about executate
 * state mutation. Event should contain all necessary details to provide full
 * details about executed behavior. Be sure to never update aggregate state
 * directly! Thats responsibility of apply method described bellow.
 *
 * Example of command:
 *
 * var BankAccount = function() {...}
 * 
 * BankAccount.withdraw = function(amount) {
 *   if(this.balance < amount) {
 *     throw new Error('Transaction declined.');
 *   }  
 *
 *   this.emit('moneyWithdrawn', {amount: amount});
 * }
 *
 *
 *
 * STATE
 * Your aggregate will have state, represented by your entities and value
 * objects. The current state of aggregate is created by setting its initial
 * state and applying all the necessary events, which are loaded from event
 * storage. 
 *
 * In order to properly rebuild the object you will have to prepare one event
 * handler for each event, which does aggregate have. Each event handler is
 * the separete function, which name is composed from 'on' and event name.
 *
 * Example of apply implementation:
 *
 * var BankAccount = function() {...}
 * 
 * BankAccount.prototype.onMoneyWithdrawn = function(event) {
 *   this.balance -= event.amount;
 * }
 * 
 *
 *
 * QUERIES
 * Because of asynchronous load of data from event storage, you have to wait
 * until your constructor callback is triggered, before you will be able to
 * read state from your aggregate.
 *
 * Example of query implementation:
 *
 * var latestBalance = 0;
 *
 * var a = new BankAccount(1234, function() {
 *   latestBalance = this.balance; // fill data to latestBalance from aggregate
 * })
 *
 * @param {Number} Unique system aggregate identifier.
